# Final-Project

I want to explore factors that influence admission requirements in order to determine salient factors for college admission. I am particularly interested in exploring the impact factors such as tuition, graduate unemployment rate, and size of the undergraduate class have an effect on the admission rate within an institution. I also want to explore the prevalence of standardized testing in the form of SAT or ACT Tests as many college admission boards have been phasing them out since the start of the pandemic. 

For the purpose of this paper, I would use the College Scorecard Dataset available through the United States Department of Education. The dataset has been last updated on March 14, 2022, and thus would provide the most accurate information on the current admission rates. The data set is available for use at the website: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/
